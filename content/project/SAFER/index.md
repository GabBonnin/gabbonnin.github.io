## Overview

**SAVER** is a multi-center research project that investigates how advanced speech analysis using large language models (LLMs) can transform psychotherapy research and practice. The project builds a comprehensive database of psychotherapy sessions across the **German Center for Mental Health (DZPG)** to explore new diagnostic, process, and intervention insights.

## Objectives

- **Predict diagnostic information** from natural speech features and content.  
- **Identify and quantify active therapeutic elements** (e.g., interventions, competencies).  
- **Model therapeutic change processes** such as alliance, motivation, and mentalizing.  
- **Evaluate speech anonymization methods** to protect privacy while preserving research value.  

## Methods

- **Naturalistic, multi-center observational study** across university clinics and training centers.  
- **Data collection:** Audio recordings of psychotherapy sessions, structured interviews, and self-report questionnaires.  
- **Speech analysis:** Multimodal methods combining acoustic features (e.g., pitch, speech rate) with semantic content using LLMs (e.g., BERT, LLaMA).  

## Timeline

- **Start:** October 2025  
- **Duration:** 48 months (data collection: 36 months)  
- **Completion:** October 2029
