Psychotherapy is one of the most effective treatments for mental health problems, but its success depends on accurate diagnostic assessments. Current assessment practices largely rely on standardized closed-ended scales that, while reliable, may fail to capture the complexity, context and individuality of patients’ mental states. Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP) enable the measurement of psychological constructs through natural language, offering a promising complement to traditional assessment methods by leveraging patients’ own descriptions of their experiences.

While previous NLP-based mental health research has primarily focused on social media language, this project applies state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) to open-ended intake data from a German outpatient psychotherapy clinic. Before therapy, patients describe the development, context, and perceived causes of their problems, as well as their current difficulties and therapy goals, in their own words. These texts are linked to key clinical measures, including diagnoses, symptom severity, functional impairment, and treatment outcomes, providing an ecologically valid resource for studying language-based assessment in real-world clinical settings.
