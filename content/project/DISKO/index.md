## Overview:

Accurate diagnosis is a cornerstone of effective psychotherapy training. Yet, teaching structured diagnostic methods often requires intensive in‑person courses, which can limit access and scalability. The [DiSkO and DiSkO KiJu](https://fbz-bochum.de/disko-und-disko-kiju) blended‑learning programs address this challenge by providing flexible, evidence‑based training in the assessment of mental disorders for adults and children/adolescents.

Both courses focus on the use of structured clinical interviews -- the [DIPS-1.2-OA](https://fbz-bochum.de/dips-oa1-2) for adults and the [Kinder‑DIPS‑OA](https://fbz-bochum.de/kinder-dips-oa) for children and adolescents -- and combine nine asynchronous online lessons with recommended synchronous sessions led by instructors. The courses are freely available via Moodle to universities across Germany, offering students and trainees accessible, high‑quality diagnostic training.

Developed and evaluated within the BMBF‑funded project Diagnostik Skills Online Lernen – DiSkO, the courses were tested in a multi‑center study with 350 students [(Bonnin et al., 2024)](https://gabbonnin.github.io/publication/a-blended-learning-course-on-the-diagnostics-of-mental-disorders-multicenter-cluster-randomized-noninferiority-trial/). Results showed that DiSkO training outperformed traditional teaching formats in both knowledge acquisition and practical interviewing skills, while receiving equally positive or better ratings in nearly all other aspects of the learning experience. This positions DiSkO as a scalable, modern approach to training future clinicians in structured diagnostic assessment.
