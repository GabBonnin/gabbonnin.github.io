## Overview:

The Infrastructure Psychotherapy Research (PT-INF) is a digital long-term data infrastructure for the systematic coordination of psychotherapy research across different age groups and clinical settings. One of the main objectives is the harmonised collection of data from routine psychotherapeutic care. In the first phase of implementation, a network of psychotherapeutic institutions will be established, a secure data platform for research coordination will be set up and standardised outcome measures will be defined.  Subsequently, guidelines for study proposals will be developed and proposals for initial test studies will be sought. The objective is to continuously expand the platform and cover a broad spectrum of psychosocial interventions and treatment settings. This includes preventive measures in various settings as well as inpatient and outpatient forms of therapy through to rehabilitative measures.
