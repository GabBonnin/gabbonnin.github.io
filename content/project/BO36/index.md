## Overview:

Long-term outcomes of psychotherapy are crucial for understanding how treatments shape mental health across the lifespan â€” yet little is known about how therapeutic effects persist beyond a few years. The BO3/6 project within the German Center for Mental Health (DZPG) addresses this gap by examining the sustainability of psychotherapy over more than a decade in children, adolescents, adults, and their families.

The study follows cohorts from randomized controlled trials and routine care settings, tracking participants annually after therapy completion. A central focus is on intergenerational dynamics: how mental disorders and therapeutic benefits are transmitted within families, and which biopsychosocial mechanisms contribute to lasting improvements in well-being. By uncovering these mechanisms, the project aims to inform evidence-based strategies that strengthen mental health and family resilience in the long term.
