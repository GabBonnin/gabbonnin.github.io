abstract: Clinical diagnostic interviews are considered the gold standard for assessing mental disorders and are thus a key tool in epidemiological research on mental health. However, due to their complexity and resource intensity, they pose specific challenges when applied in large-scale population-based studies. In mid-2023, this expert report was commissioned by the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) to provide a systematic overview of internationally used clinical interviews and to evaluate their suitability for mental health surveillance in German-speaking populations — with a particular focus on their potential for open-source digital implementation.
This report is structured in three parts: (1) criteria and requirements for evaluating clinical diagnostic interviews, (2) a systematic overview of relevant instruments, and (3) practical recommendations for implementing mental health surveillance.
The aim is to identify interviews that enable valid, feasible, and widely accepted assessment of mental disorders — especially in the context of large-scale, resource-efficient, and future-ready population studies.
